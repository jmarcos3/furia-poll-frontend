# 🗳️ PollsApp Frontend

A Single-Page Application built with **React**, **TypeScript** and **Vite** that consumes the PollsApp backend API (🔗 [PollsApp Backend](https://github.com/jmarcos3/pollsApp-backend)). Features include:

- Axios-powered HTTP requests for creating, listing and voting on polls  
- Client-side pagination for seamless navigation  
- JWT support for authenticated actions  
- Modular components and hooks for easy scalability  

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **React** + **TypeScript**  
- **Vite** for fast builds and HMR  
- **Axios** for API communication  
- **TailwindCSS** *(optional)* for utility-first styling  

## 📚 Learnings

Working on this frontend taught me how to:

- Structure a component-driven React app with TypeScript  
- Use React hooks (useState, useEffect, custom hooks) for state & side effects  
- Configure Vite for environment variables and fast reloads  
- Handle HTTP requests, responses & errors with Axios  
- Implement client-side pagination and loading states  
- Manage JWT tokens in localStorage and attach them to requests  
- Build reusable, strongly-typed UI components  
- Apply responsive styling with TailwindCSS  
- Organize code for scalability and maintainability
